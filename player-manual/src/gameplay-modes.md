# Gameplay Modes
FossXO supports both single-player and multiplayer tic-tac-toe games.

## Single-player
Battle the computer in single-player mode. Choose from three difficulty 
settings: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

#### Easy
Easy difficulty is for players who are new to tic-tac-toe and/or
computer games. Use this to learn the game's [rules](ttt-rules.md) and 
[controls](controls.md).

#### Medium
Medium difficulty is for players who have some experience with tic-tac-toe. 
The game provides a challenge, but with careful planning and strategy
there are many paths to victory.

#### Hard
Hard difficulty is for experienced tic-tac-toe players. To win you must 
capitalize on rare mistakes made by the game while avoiding any mistakes
of your own. Expect most games to end in a cat's game.


## Multiplayer
Local multiplayer allows you to play tic-tac-toe with your friends.

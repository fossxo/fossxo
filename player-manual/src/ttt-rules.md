# How to Play Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy where two players, X and O, take turns placing
their mark in a 3 x 3 gird. The rules are as follows:

1. The grid starts empty with no marks.
1. The first player places their mark in one of the grid's squares.
1. The second player places their mark in one of the grid's empty squares. 
   A square that already contains a mark cannot be updated or altered. 
1. Turns alternate between the players until the game is over.
1. The first player to get three of their marks in a line wins the game.
   That is: they have three marks in a row, column, or diagonally.
1. The game can also ends in a draw, known as a *cat's game*, if no more
   empty squares remain and a player has failed to get three marks in a
   row, column, or diagonally.

# FossXO

FossXO is a unique take on the classic game of tic-tac-toe. Battle the
computer or challenge your friends to a game.

FossXO is free and open-source software (FOSS) distributed under the permissive
MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. In fact, FossXO's name comes from combining the
acronym FOSS with XO, an alternate name for tic-tac-toe.

This manual describes [how to play tic-tac-toe](ttt-rules.md), the different
[gameplay modes](gameplay-modes.md), and the game's [controls](controls.md).

Thanks for playing!
